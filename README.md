Website to visualise data

Based on my work using databases and creating a table for userTransactions and Products for my Team Project module.

Created a website database-inspired table. Used HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and SweetAlert2.

Functionality:
-	Products are stored together in database 
o	This is done to ensure everything is quickly visible and comparable
-	Can search by name
o	Ensure quick access to specific products
-	Can sort by type (drink / sweets)
o	If you only want to view one type of product
-	Can sort by quantity (make it ascending)
o	To easily see the products in ascending order to make comparison easier
-	Can edit the quantity â€“ which changes the session variable and makes changes permanent (while the session is active)
o	To make changes to the quantity
